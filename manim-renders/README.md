# Manim Renders

This folder contains all of the manim renders used in the project. The renders are organized by folder, with each folder containing a specific type of render (e.g. data structures, algorithms, etc.). The renders are then organized by subfolder, with each subfolder containing a specific type of render (e.g. linked lists, stacks, etc.). The renders are then named according to the following format: `<render_name>_<render_number>.mp4`.

The renders are used to display animations in the web application. The animations are used to help explain complex concepts in an easy to understand way. The renders are also used to add visual interest to the web application.

The renders are created using the manim library, which is a Python library for creating mathematical animations. The library is used to create the animations, and then the animations are rendered out as mp4 files. The mp4 files are then used in the web application to display the animations.
